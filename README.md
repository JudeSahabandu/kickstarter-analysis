# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

This report is a quantitative exploratory analysis of kickstarter campaigns. Despite the data being fragmented across multiple categories of campaigns, our data focus is on campaigns under the theater category, with special emphasis on the plays and musicals sub categories.

The regions under scrutiny are the United States and the United Kingdom.

The objective of the analysis is to identify trends which caused success and failure of past campaigns, to inform decisions on new kickstarter campaign set-up.
